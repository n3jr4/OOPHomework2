Task from the lecture:

1. Create 2 classes Classroom and Students.
   Classroom class:
   contains a list of students
   has 1 constructor, without parameters creating an empty classroom
   addStudent - adds a student to the underlying list
   isPresent(String name) - checks if a student with provided name is present
   printClassroom() - prints the classroom (the list of students)
   • Student class:
   2 attributes: name and age
   2 constructors: 1 parameter (String name), setting the age to 15, 2 parameters
   setting the attributes
   1 method: toString() returning String representation of Student - name, age

1. Homework:
   Create the class Bookshelf. The bookshelf class holds Books (class) in a list of Books.
   Book:
   Attributes:
   title - String
   ISBN - long
   author - String
   Constructor:
   3 parameters, setting the values of attributes
   Method:
   toString() - returning a String in the format title, author (ISBN)
   Bookshelf:
   1 Attribute being a list of Books
   Constructor without parameters, creating an empty BookShelf
   Methods:
   containsBook(String title) - returning boolean depending if the shelf contains a Book with the
   provided title
   containsBook(long ISBN) - returning boolean depending if the shelf contains a Book with the
   provided ISBN
   printBookshelf() - prints all Books from the bookshelf

2. Create the class Robot. The Robot moves on a plane similar to a coordinate system.
   It has 2 constructors:
   Without parameters - the Robot starts at position (0,0)
   With 2 parameters - initialises the Robot at position (x,y)
   The Robot has couple of methods:
   moveSouth() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will decrease the y.position by 1
   moveNorth() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will increase the y.position by 1
   moveEast() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will increase the x.position by 1
   moveWest() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will decrease the x.position by 1
   getPosition() - return current position
   double getDistance() - returns the euclidean distance from the initial position
   The distance is calculated as sqrt((x0 - x1)2 + (y0 - y1)2), where (x0, y0) is the initial position and
   (x1, y1) being the current position. The distance is a double.
   getMoves() - return the number of moves the Robot performed
   printLastPosition(int n) - prints the n last position starting from the last (backwards)
   if n > number of moves, print all moves
   Example of print:
   (2,5)
   (1,5)
   (1,4)
